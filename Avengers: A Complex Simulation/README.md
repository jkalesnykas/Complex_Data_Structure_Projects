**Summary**

This project consists of several files that involve working with graphs and the adjacency matrix graph storage. Each file has a specific task and utilizes various graph-related algorithms and concepts to achieve its objective. The files include ForgeStormBreaker.java, LocateTitan.java, MindStoneNeighborNeurons.java, UseTimeStone.java, and PredictThanosSnap.java. Each file performs a distinct operation on a given input file and produces specific output.

**Skills Utilized**

The development of these graph-related tasks requires advanced programming skills, including graph traversal, adjacency matrix manipulation, algorithm implementation, and file input/output handling. Working with graphs involves understanding graph representation, graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, and graph connectivity. The project also involves data structure manipulation and file handling to read input files and write output files. By working on these tasks, you can enhance your proficiency in graph manipulation, algorithmic problem-solving, and data handling.
